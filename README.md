# Mule's Tools
Collection of little web-based tools that may or may not be useful.
Hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Deploying
To deploy a new version of the `master` branch:

    $ npm run build
    $ npm run deploy

This should create a production build and then push to the `gh-pages` branch in the repo, effectively updating the hosted distribution.
